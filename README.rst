Introduction
============

This Plone product allows some cache tuning for your site.
Currently it only allows username replacment, but we might add some
more features in the future.


Username replacement
--------------------

If you enable this option, you can cache the whole pages and an Ajax
request will replace the username in the page in order to reduce the
load.

If you use a custom theme, you can specify the query used to select
the HTML node containing the username. This query is written in the
classic CSS format.

Extra libraries
---------------

The Javascript cookie setting is done using jquery.cookie.js, written
by Klaus Hartl.
The project is hosted at https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie.
